A mysterious magic is turning the world upside down in Equestria. It's up to you to take the power of friendship to a new level and embark on a mysterious adventure for one or two ponies.

With the teamwork of all the ponies, uncover unstable magic that turns phones into pizzas, breaks gravity and splashes colors everywhere.

Play as Sunny, Hitch, Izzy, Pipp, Zipp and Misty and use your special skills to explore Zephyr Heights, a city in the sky filled with pegasus, special collectibles, and photo opportunities with your favorite ponies.

You'll also have a great time with your pony friends, with hilarious mini-games like Pipp's Photo Shoot, Hitch is on his way and Sunny's Smoothie Delivery, plus a closet full of accessories to show off your personal style.

It's time to bring tranquility back to Zephyr Heights!
