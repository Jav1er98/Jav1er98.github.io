Production is an interesting concept within the universe of video game development and one that frequently generates a mix of feelings and opinions about this discipline that, depending on the point of view, can be good or bad.

If we look at it from the narrowest point of view, from that of a worker, production is strongly associated with the figure of the producer, with time constraints and demands, with unnecessary and illogical haste that undermines the creativity and quality of the video game. This opinion becomes quasi-religious when, in addition, the subject is related to external production and an editor, a figure that is practically led to the concept of ''diabolical''.

If we look up a little and see it from the point of view of the management of a company, production is seen as a millimeter control tool rather than from a concept close to the beginning of management and Taylorism, something that allows us to maintain close and effective supervision of the teams working on the development of the idea. This control carried out without having the necessary communication capacity and flexibility, ends up reinforcing the first vision that exists about it.

In this way we were able to visualize video game production in a traditional way, something that has always been associated with:
1. The design of a video game.
2. A work team.
3. A development technology.

A video game company can develop and launch a video game with a minimum of quality in a time that is feasible and economically acceptable for it.

To organize this in a more efficient way, there are various project management methodologies and processes that allow the creation of a framework of knowledge to control time, resources and costs. There are various types of methodologies, from the most classic, Waterfall, to the recent agile ones such as Scrum or Pair Programming. It is important to highlight that these methodologies are not exclusive to the world of videogames, but the result of work and research in many industries.

If the entire process runs correctly, the company would have, with a controlled production cost, a minimum acceptable quality and, in the stipulated time, a video game ready to start distributing and generating new economic funds. And if not, a serious problem for its survival, given that a production imbalance can generate dangerous imbalances in the management of any type of company.

Until very recently, the most normal thing was for a Publisher to pay for the production costs of a video game, so the risks of the study would be more on the operational side than on the strategy side. In recent years, with the unstoppable growth of video game publishing, the vast majority of which are free, a great wave of change has been generated throughout the industry. In addition, there is less and less chance of finding a Publisher to finance the video game, generating most of the doubts in the studies, about what project to do, to what extent to do it, what profitability could be obtained from it and, above all, how not die trying.

As a result of this new reality, the production has gained that strategic facet, very close to that of marketing and financing, where it must help the company to design and make the decision on the next video game to develop.

Sure, there will always be studios with a more romantic approach to making their games the way and at the pace they want, but the risks associated with such a decision could be enough to stone our project and our company to stone.

From the world of startup methodologies and product management, it is increasingly common to hear about Lean methodologies and the Minimum Viable Product (minimum viable product), which is like the smallest possible video game, fun enough to to be able to be played by players on a recurring basis. It is not a guarantee of success, but it is one more stone in the attempt to try to get a strong enough base to resist the turmoil in the industry.

This is where production approaches strategic marketing since it has to be supported by the validation of the hypotheses and the possibilities that should guide the decision process about the video game to be developed and its final scope in order to meet those objectives. without trying to lose the main objective of entertaining the player.

It sounds easy, and in theory it should be, but it's not. And it is that, the video game industry has a tendency to maximize the functionalities and the quality of its products until they quickly exhaust the capacity of the current generation hardware, so the good sense of designing a minimum scheme goes against of the way of thinking of maximums so present in the industry.

In addition, it should be noted that, as we have seen previously, the company was always supported during the production process by the Publisher's team, through the figure of an external Publisher who acted as a link between the publisher and the developer (not without his tensions), but that helped in some way to rationalize the efforts within the publication objectives defined for the game, as well as to better understand the concepts of audience and what they could look for from our video game.

If it was not difficult enough to know our audience now, it is also a dynamic audience that must be tracked through analytics to understand the changes in expectations and their perception of the video game. In this way we can modify it continuously over time. This is a reality that is closer to operations management than to project management, but one that must also be taken into account in the new reality of video game production.

Now, the responsibility of rationalizing this continuous process down to the smallest detail falls, for the most part, on production and producers (now also service managers). It is a critical task that continues over time since, if done incorrectly, it can result for the company running out of resources before the video game can be used to replace them or, if it fails to control the production/operation objectives , seeing how the video game may not gain enough traction and, therefore, not generate the necessary financial return to continue with the operation of the company and the start-up of the next project.
