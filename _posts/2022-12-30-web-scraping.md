## Development of the Game

---
### üêû Bug Detection and Resolution Across Multiple Platforms

My primary responsibility was the detection and resolution of critical bugs that could completely compromise a playthrough, requiring players to restart the game from scratch. These bugs represented a significant risk to the user experience and necessitated immediate and effective solutions to ensure continuous and satisfactory gameplay.

### üõ†Ô∏è Patch Deployment and Updates

Once critical bugs were identified and resolved, I spearheaded the patch deployment process for all compatible consoles. This involved coordinating with development teams and ensuring that updates were rolled out in a timely and efficient manner across all platforms. Our goal was to provide players with an enhanced and bug-free gaming experience, even after the initial launch of the game in the market.
