<p>I am a game developer with experience in programming and game design. I specialize in Unity and have skills in C# and C++. My goal is to work on ambitious projects and collaborate with a talented team to create exciting and fun games.</p>

<p>I want to work at a game studio to develop ambitious projects and collaborate with other talented developers. I wish to continue learning and improving my skills in programming, game design, and 3D modeling to create even better games.</p>

<p class="mb-5">I love playing games of all genres, especially strategy and RPG games. I also enjoy creating my own games in my free time and participating in indie game projects. I like to keep up with trends in game development and experiment with new technologies and tools.</p>
