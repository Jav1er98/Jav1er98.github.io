## Final Practice: 2D game prototype.
## Introduction

The project is a 2D side-scrolling platform game that will have a character who runs, jumps and avoids obstacles and needs to go from the beginning to the end of the level. It will have a little loading system so that when you finish a particular level it will load into the next level and so on using the unit TileMap system.

## Coins
Some coins have been added so that the player can collect them as a points system, which when collected disappears and adds 100 points. This has been done by adding some animations to the coins and their logic through the CoinPickup script. For testing, a sound was added when the player takes the coin.
