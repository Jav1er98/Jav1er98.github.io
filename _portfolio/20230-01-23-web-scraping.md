## Create a GOAP project

The theme is completely free, for example you can simulate a town with agents of all kinds (cooks, bakers, farmers, miners, blacksmiths, bankers, vendors, thieves, bailiffs, firefighters,...). As a reference, a project with 3 types of agents and 6 actions in total is a pass. From there, it will be graded based on its complexity.

Simulation of a catwalk of models, where we will have three agents that will be the following:
     
1. Public agent (Blue): who attends the fashion show

      - Goes to the entrance of the building then to the seats
      - Watch the models
      - Finally leaves the building   
      
2. VIP agent (Red): has a special area to go where to be placed together with the rest of the vips

      - Enter through the building's VIP entrance
      - He goes to the VIP area and watches the models
      - He finally leaves the building
   
3. Models agent (Rose): the stars of the catwalk
       
      - They head to the entrance of your walkway
      - They parade on the catwalk, wait for the moment to be observed and take another turn
      - Then they finally leave the catwalk
       
4. Result:
